Tester Output and Description:

This is the String array I have created to test the methods in BasicAligner.java:
	String[] sequence = {"QWERTYUIOP", "UIO"};


Test 1: This test is checking the output of the performAlignment method 
		

	Input:	test.performAlignment();
	
	Output: This test has no output. The way I was able to test this was by finding
		the off set which will be presented later.


Test 2: This test is checking the output of the getNumErrors method 
	

	Input: 	if (test.getNumErrors() == 0){
			System.out.println("Test 2: Passed");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Test 2: FAILED");
		}
	
	Output:	“Test 2: Passed”
	

Test 3: This test is checking the output of the getSequence method at position 0
		

	Input:	if (test.getSequence(0) == sequence[0]){
			System.out.println("Test 3: Passed");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Test 3: FAILED");
		}
	
	Output: “Test 3: Passed”
	

Test 4: This test is checking the output of the getSequence method at position 1
		
	
	Input:	if (test.getSequence(1) == sequence[1]){
			System.out.println("Test 4: Passed");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Test 4: FAILED");
		}
	
	Output:	“Test 4: Passed”
	
	
Test 5: This test is checking the output of the getOffset method
		
		
	Input:	if (test.getOffset(1) == 6){
			System.out.println("Test 5: Passed");
		} else {
			System.out.println("Test 5: FAILED");
		}
	
	Output:	“Test 5: Passed”
