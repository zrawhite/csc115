Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about
telescopes.

Programming is one of the most difficult branches of applied
mathematics; the poorer mathematicians had better remain pure
mathematicians.

The competent programmer is fully aware of the limited size of his
own skull. He therefore approaches his task with full humility, and
avoids clever tricks like the plague.

The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting
than the question of whether a submarine can swim.

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never
to show their absence!

Edsger Dijkstra quotes
